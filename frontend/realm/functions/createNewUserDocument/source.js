  /*
    An Authentication Trigger will always call a function with an authEvent.
    Documentation on Triggers: https://docs.mongodb.com/realm/triggers/overview/

    Access the user associated with the authEvent:
    const user = authEvent.user

    Access the time the authEvent happened:
    const time = authEvent.time

    Access the operation type for the authEvent:
    const operationType = authEvent.operationType

    Access the providers associated with the authEvent:
    const providers = authEvent.providers

    Functions run by Triggers are run as System users and have full access to Services, Functions, and MongoDB Data.

    Access a mongodb service:
    const collection = context.services.get("<SERVICE_NAME>").db("<DB_NAME>").collection("<COLL_NAME>");
    const doc = collection.findOne({ name: "mongodb" });

    Call other named functions if they are defined in your application:
    const result = context.functions.execute("function_name", arg1, arg2);

    Access the default http client and execute a GET request:
    const response = context.http.get({ url: <URL> })

    Learn more about http client here: https://docs.mongodb.com/realm/functions/context/#context-http
